Goal:
=====
“Create a Budget class that can instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food,
 clothing, and entertainment. These objects should allow for depositing and withdrawing funds from each
 category, as well computing category balances and transferring balance amounts between categories”

Considerations:
===============
this is a very interesting project as it allows not only to comprehend how a class is
initialized and used, but also represented and used as input to other functions. You will learn how to
add methods to your classes and print them in a way that allows complex representation of your class
object at different points in the program. As a bonus, you will define a function that computes how
much money you are spending across class categories as a % of your total expenses, something that
can be very useful for the money-savvy programmers among you.

Approach:
=========
define the purpose and flexibility of a class object; build its class methods using a modular
approach and develop an understanding for how different instances of the same class can interact.

Key concepts:
=============
Class initialization, instance methods and instance representation. Defining and using
functions that take class instances as input parameters
